[{"content":"What is C? C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.\nWhy C? C is a middle-level language, and it combines the high-level language features with the low-level language features.\nWhat is C used for? C is a general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop the operating system like UNIX, Linux, etc. It is also used to develop the applications software like MS Office, Google Chrome, etc.\nRoadmap for C 1.

It is the process where we use data to generalize the useful insights. And the overall process is done by professionals like data analysts and data scientists. From the data, you must be able to ask questions and be prepared to answer it. Suppose, there is a lot of data from the Census. So, think what could be the possible questions? You may think, how many people are married, or have children? Which age group of people are in foreign? What is the literacy rate?  What is data?  These are the facts, values, figures, texts, audio, videos which get generated by ourselves in day-to-day life. These are generated from our smartphones, photos, videos and texts. In the beginning, they are not being analyzed or utilized for solving business problems. Hours of videos are being uploaded in YouTube every second, thousands of Facebook users are posting something every minute etc. Information: The meaningful insights that come from data after proper analysis of it is information.  Data  Volume Velocity Veracity Value Variety  RoadMap | Data Scientist  Data Scientist are those skilled person who solves real world problem using the data. These are the genius who collect the data, analyze the data, manipulate the data, visualize the data and extracts useful information from the data. These are the skills the data scientist must have.
